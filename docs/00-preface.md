## Author Motivation {-}

Data analysis in microbiome studies can be a costly endeavor, often amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more when using incorrect approaches. Recognizing the need for support within the microbiome data analysis community, I was inspired to write this book. My motivation stemmed from the bookdown package [@bookdown2021], which caught my attention as it builds upon the R Markdown package [@rmarkdown2018]. Drawing from my experience in a separate microbiome-related project [@TMBuza2019], I felt a deep desire to make a meaningful impact in this field by providing reproducible solutions.

Through self-training and continuous learning, I have acquired a significant amount of knowledge since my last publication. My passion lies in creating visually appealing HTML user guides that transform complex data into actionable insights. This book is a culmination of that passion and the expertise I have gained along the way.Throughout my journey, two constant companions have been by my side: Google and ChatGPT. Google has been my go-to resource, enabling me to search for additional insights and solutions, expanding my knowledge in microbiome data analysis. Likewise, ChatGPT, an AI language model, has been a valuable companion, assisting me in refining my ideas and exploring new possibilities.

With the shared goal of fostering reproducibility and driving impactful discoveries in microbiome research, I hope this book serves as a valuable resource for the users. Together, with the aid of technological advancements and a collaborative community, we can navigate the challenges of microbiome data analysis, unlock new knowledge, and make significant contributions to this fascinating field.

While the book doesn't claim to be exhaustive, it encourages readers to explore additional solutions. With a shared goal of fostering reproducibility and impactful discoveries in microbiome research, this resource aims to support researchers, students, developers, trainers, and enthusiasts in navigating challenges and contributing to this dynamic field.
