# Welcome to Microbiome Practical User Guides {-}
<!-- <a href=""><img src="images/cover.png" alt="Book cover" width="100%" style="padding: 30px 0px 30px 0px; float: none;"/></a> -->
Microbiome data analysis is an inquiry-driven approach aimed at unraveling the intricate microbial composition within a given sample. By asking targeted questions, we embark on a journey to uncover the hidden insights encoded in microbiome data. In the Systematic Microbiome Data Analytics (SMDA) Practical User Guide series, we go beyond traditional analysis methods, providing practical guides that empower researchers to delve deeper into the vast realm of microbiome analysis. Our mission is to transform complex data into actionable knowledge, driving the understanding of microbial communities to new frontiers.

As we embark on this ongoing project, we divide the eBook into multiple standalone parts, each dedicated to a comprehensive exploration of distinct facets of microbiome analysis. These parts serve as valuable resources, equipping researchers with the tools and insights to navigate the intricacies of microbial community dynamics.

Through the SMDA series, we aim to unravel the role of microorganisms in disease, health, and their impact on the environment. By integrating cutting-edge techniques and methodologies, we strive to provide integrated solutions for gaining a holistic understanding of microbial community biodiversity.

Join us in this exciting journey of discovery as we unlock the mysteries concealed within microbiome data. Together, let's embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the fascinating realm of microbiome data analysis.
